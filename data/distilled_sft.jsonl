{"mbpp_index": 12, "prompt": "Write a function to find the maximum value in record list as tuple attribute in the given tuple list.", "assistant": "<START_WORKING_OUT>\nWe need to create a function that takes a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an attribute that is a list of records (or values). The task is to find the maximum value across all elements in all the record lists contained in these tuples.\n\nWe can use a generator expression or nested loops to iterate through each tuple, access its list attribute (assuming it's at a specific index, e.g., index 1 if the tuple has (id, list) structure), and then iterate through each value in that list, collecting all values. Then use max() to find the maximum.\n\nBut the problem statement is ambiguous: it says \"record list as tuple attribute.\" Without more context, we assume that the record list is at a known index (e.g., index 1) in each tuple. We can make the function flexible by allowing an optional parameter for the index of the attribute.\n\nAlternatively, if the tuple only has one element which is the list, then the index is 0.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, we'll create a function that takes two arguments: the tuple list and an optional index (default 0) specifying where the record list is in each tuple.\n\nWe'll use a generator expression that flattens all the record lists and then apply max. If the resulting sequence is empty, we need to handle that\u2014return None or raise an exception? We'll follow Python's convention: max() on empty sequence raises ValueError. But we can let that propagate or handle. Since the problem doesn't specify, we'll let it raise ValueError.\n\nThus: def find_max_in_record_lists(tuple_list, record_list_index=0):\n    return max(value for t in tuple_list for value in t[record_list_index])\n\nBut what if the tuple has more attributes? The record list must be at the given index. We'll assume that.\n\nEdge cases: empty tuple list: generator yields nothing, max raises ValueError. That's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a default value: e.g., max(..., default=None) to return None if empty. We'll choose that to be safe.\n\nSo: return max((value for t in tuple_list for value in t[record_list_index]), default=None)\n</END_WORKING_OUT>\n<SOLUTION>\ndef find_max_in_record_lists(tuple_list, record_list_index=0):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the maximum value across all record lists in a list of tuples.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    tuple_list (list of tuples): Each tuple contains a record list at the specified index.\n    record_list_index (int): The index of the record list in each tuple.
