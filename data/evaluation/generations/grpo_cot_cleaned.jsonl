{"task_id": "HumanEval/46", "completion": "    <START_WORKING_OUT>\n    The problem requires computing the n-th element of the fib4 sequence without using recursion. The sequence is defined for n >= 0, with specific base cases for n=0,1,2,3. For n >= 4, each term is the sum of the four preceding terms. This is a linear recurrence relation that can be solved iteratively to avoid exponential time complexity of a naive recursive approach.\n\n    We can compute the sequence iteratively from the base cases up to n. We need to handle n=0,1,2,3 separately and then for n>=4, compute each subsequent term by summing the previous four terms. We can use a loop that runs from 4 to n, updating a rolling window of the last four computed terms.\n\n    The function should return the n-th term directly. We can use an array or list to store the last four terms, updating them in each step. The length of the sequence we compute is n+1 (from index 0 to n), so we loop from 4 to n. After the loop, the n-th term (at index n) is the last element in our list.\n\n    We need to handle edge cases: n=0,1,2,3 return the known values 0,0,2,0 respectively. For n=4, we compute fib4(4) = fib4(3) + fib4(2) + fib4(1) + fib4(0) = 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 = 2. For n=5, we compute fib4(5) = fib4(4) + fib4(3) + fib4(2) + fib4(1) = 2 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 4, and so on.\n\n    We can implement this with a list of length 4 initialized to [0,0,2,0] for n=3, then extend by computing each subsequent term up to n. Alternatively, we can compute exactly n+1 terms by updating four variables directly in the loop. Both approaches are valid, but using a list might be clearer for understanding.\n\n    We'll use an iterative approach with a list to store the last four terms. We initialize the list with the base cases for n=0,1,2,3. Then we loop from 4 to n, computing each new term as the sum of the previous four terms and updating the list. After the loop, the n-th term is the last element in the list. We return this value.\n\n    We need to handle n=0,1,2,3 directly by returning the known values. For n>=4, we compute the sequence iteratively. The function should work for all non-negative integers n. We can use a while loop that increments a counter until we reach the n-th term, updating the list of last four terms each time.\n\n    We'll implement this with a while loop that runs from 4 to n, updating the list of last four terms. We start with the base cases [0,0,2,0] for n=3. Then we compute each subsequent term by summing the last four terms and append it to the list. After the loop, the n-th term is the last element in the list. We return this value.\n\n    We can optimize by only keeping the last four terms in the list, so the list always contains the four most recent terms. We update the list by slicing and adding the new term. The list length is n+1, so we loop from 4 to n. We can use list slicing to update the list: new_list = [list[-1], list[-2], list[-3], list"}

Generate all prime numbers less than 100 using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.\n    2. For each number `a` from 2 to 99, check if it can be expressed as the product of exactly three primes.\n    3. To check for three prime factors, iterate through possible prime factors `p1` (starting from the smallest prime). For each `p1`, divide `a` by `p1` (if divisible) and get `a2 = a // p1`. Then iterate through primes `p2` greater than `p1` and divide `a2` by `p2` (if divisible) to get `a3 = a2 // p2`. If `a3` is a prime number, then `a = p1 * p2 * a3` is the product of three primes. If no such combination is found, return `False`.\n    4. Edge cases: numbers less than 2 are invalid, and numbers that are products of fewer or more than three primes should return `False`.\n    5. Optimization: Since `a < 100`, we only need primes up to 97 (the largest prime less than 100). We can precompute all primes up to 99 using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.\n    6. Implementation steps:\n       - Create a list `is_prime` of boolean values from 0 to 99, initializing all to `True`. Set `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` to `False` because 0 and 1 are not primes.\n       - For each integer `i` from 2 to 99, if `is_prime[i]` is `True`, then `i` is prime. Mark all multiples of `i` starting from `i*i` as `False` (they are not prime).\n       - After sieving, `is_prime[p]` is `True` if `p` is prime.\n       - For each `a` from 2 to 99, iterate through possible prime factors `p1`. For each `p1`, compute `a2 = a // p1` (integer division). Then iterate through primes `p2 > p1` and compute `a3 = a2 // p2`. If `a3` is prime and `a == p1 * p2 * a3`, then return `True`.\n       - If no combination of three primes multiplies to `a`, return `False`.\n    7. Edge cases: numbers less than 2 should return `False`. Numbers that are products of exactly three primes should return `True`. Numbers that are products of fewer or more than three primes should return `False`.\n    8. The function should work for all integers `a` in the range 2 to 99.\n    9. The solution should be efficient given the constraint `a < 100`.\n    10.

{"task_id": "HumanEval/109", "completion": "    <START_WORKING_OUT>\n    The problem requires determining if we can sort an array in non-decreasing order\n    by performing any number of right shift operations. A right shift moves each element\n    one position to the right, with the last element moving to the front.\n\n    Approach:\n    1. If the array is empty, return True by definition.\n    2. Create a sorted version of the array. Since we need non-decreasing order, sorted(arr) works.\n    3. Count the number of positions we need to shift to make the original array match the sorted array.\n       This is done by finding the index where the sorted array starts to differ from the original array.\n       We can do this by comparing elements from the front. The number of shifts needed is the length\n       of the array minus this index (if the index is valid).\n    4. If the number of shifts needed is less than the array length, then it means we can achieve\n       the sorted order by rotating (shifting) the array that many positions to the right.\n    5. Edge case: If the array is already sorted, we can consider 0 shifts, which is valid.\n    6. We can implement this by iterating through the array and counting how many times the original\n       array's element is greater than the sorted array's element. When we first find a mismatch,\n       we start counting. If we find another mismatch later, it means the array isn't cyclically\n       sortable by right shifts, so we return False. If we complete the loop without finding another\n       mismatch, then the number of shifts needed is equal to the length of the array minus the\n       first occurrence index of the mismatch. If this number is less than the array length, return True.\n    7. Alternatively, we can use a single pass to count the number of positions we need to shift.\n       We count how many times the current element in the original array is greater than the current\n       element in the sorted array. If we ever have to \"rotate\" past the end of the array (i.e., the\n       count exceeds the array length), then it's impossible to sort by right shifts, so return False.\n       If we complete the loop and the count is less than the array length, then it's possible, so return True.\n    8. Edge case: If the array has one element, it's trivially sorted, so return True.\n    9. We can implement this by iterating through the array with an index i. For each element,\n       compare it to the element at the same position in the sorted array. If the original element\n       is greater, increment a shift counter. If the shift counter exceeds the array length, return False.\n       If we complete the loop and the shift counter is less than the array length, return True.\n    10. Alternatively, we can find the index where the sorted array starts to \"fall behind\" the original\n        array. This is the index where the original element is greater than the sorted element. Once we\n        find this index, we check that all subsequent elements in the original array are less than or\n        equal to the elements at that index in the sorted array. If we find a violation, return False.\n        If we complete the loop without finding a violation, then the number of shifts needed is\n        n - (first_index + 1), where n is the array length. If this is less than n, return True.\n    11. We can implement this by finding the index of the first element that is greater than the\n        element at the same position in the sorted array.

{"task_id": "HumanEval/126", "completion": "    <START_WORKING_OUT>\n    The problem requires checking if a list of non-negative integers is sorted in ascending order.\n    Additionally, if there are more than one occurrence of the same number adjacent to each other, the list should be considered unsorted.\n    We need to iterate through the list and check two conditions:\n    1. Each element should be greater than or equal to the previous element.\n    2. No element should be equal to the previous element more than once consecutively.\n    We can implement this by comparing each element with the one before it. If we find an element that is smaller than the previous, the list is not sorted. If we find two equal adjacent elements, we need to ensure that they are not consecutive duplicates (i.e., they appear more than once in a row). We can do this by keeping track of the last seen value and its count. If we see the same value twice in a row, we return False. Otherwise, we continue checking. If we finish the loop without finding any violations, the list is sorted according to the rules, so we return True.\n    We can start by initializing variables: `n` for the length of the list, `last_val` to store the last seen value, and `last_count` to count consecutive occurrences of `last_val`. Then we iterate through the list starting from the second element. For each element, we compare it with `last_val`. If it's smaller, we return False. If it's equal, we increment `last_count`. If it's larger, we reset `last_count` to 1. After updating `last_val`, if `last_count` is 2, we return False because we have two consecutive duplicates. At the end of the loop, if we haven't returned False, we return True.\n    We need to handle edge cases: an empty list or a list with one element should return True (vacuously true). We can add a check for `n < 2` at the beginning. Alternatively, we can start the loop from index 1 and handle the first element separately by comparing with `None` (though that's not standard practice). The simplest approach is to start from index 1 and compare with the element at index `i-1`. If we find any violation, return False. If we finish the loop, return True.\n    We can implement this logic using a single loop that goes through the list once, making it O(n) time complexity, which is optimal for this problem. The space complexity is O(1) since we only use a few extra variables.\n    We can write the function with a clear structure: check for empty or single-element lists, then iterate through the list starting from the second element, and apply the rules for checking sorted order and consecutive duplicates. We can use a `for` loop with an index or a `while` loop. A `for` loop is more Pythonic and concise. We'll use `for i in range(1, n)` to iterate through the list.\n    We'll define the function `is_sorted` that takes a list `lst` as input. We'll start by checking if the list has 2 or fewer elements. If so, we return `True` because lists of length 0 or 1 are trivially sorted. Then we initialize `last_val` to `None` (or the first element, but since we start from index 1, we can just compare with `None`), `last_count` to 0, and `n` to the length of the list. We'll then loop through the list starting from index 1. For each element at index `i`, we compare it with `last_val`. If it's smaller, we return `False`. If it's equal, we increment `"}

When we encounter a closing bracket, we decrement the counter.

{"task_id": "HumanEval/148", "completion": "    <START_WORKING_OUT>\n    The problem requires writing a function `bf` that takes two planet names as strings and returns a tuple of planets orbiting between them, sorted by proximity to the Sun. The function should return an empty tuple if either planet name is invalid. The list of valid planet names (in order of increasing distance from the Sun) is: \n    [\"Mercury\", \"Venus\", \"Earth\", \"Mars\", \"Jupiter\", \"Saturn\", \"Uranus\", \"Neptune\"]. \n\n    The function needs to handle two cases: \n    1. The first planet is closer to the Sun than the second planet. In this case, we need to find all planets between the first planet (inclusive) and the second planet (exclusive). \n    2. The first planet is farther from the Sun than the second planet. This is the reverse case, so we can solve it by swapping the input planet names and then reversing the resulting tuple. \n\n    The function should check if both input planet names are valid. If either is invalid, it should return an empty tuple. \n\n    We can implement this logic using list slicing. First, we create a list of all planet names in order. Then, for each input planet name, we check if it is in this list. If both are valid, we determine the starting and ending indices for slicing. The starting index is the first occurrence of the first planet name, and the ending index is the first occurrence of the second planet name. We then slice the list from the starting index to the ending index (exclusive) and return the resulting tuple. If either planet name is invalid, we return an empty tuple. \n\n    We can use the `index()` method to find the positions of the planet names in the list. If a planet name is not found, `index()` will raise a `ValueError`, so we can catch this exception to return an empty tuple. Alternatively, we can use `in` to check for validity and then compute the indices manually. \n\n    Finally, we need to handle the case where the first planet is farther from the Sun than the second planet by swapping the planet names and then reversing the resulting tuple. \n\n    We can implement this logic using a generator expression or list comprehension to filter the planets between the two given planets, but since we already have the list of all planets, slicing is more efficient. \n\n    The function should be case-insensitive. We can convert both input planet names to lowercase before comparing them to the planet names in the list. \n\n    We can write a test function to verify the correctness of `bf` using the provided example cases. \n\n    We can also add more test cases to cover edge cases, such as when the two planets are the same, when one planet is the closest or farthest, and when one or both planet names are invalid. \n\n    We can use the `assert` statement to check that the function returns the expected results for each test case. \n\n    We can also consider using the `all()` function to check if both planet names are valid before attempting to slice the list. \n\n    We can also consider using the `sorted()` function with a custom key to sort the planets by their position in the list, but since the list is already sorted by distance from the Sun, slicing is more straightforward. \n\n    We can also consider using the `set` data structure to store the planet names, but since we need to return a tuple of planet names in a specific order, a list or tuple is more appropriate. \n\n    We can also consider using the `itertools` module for more advanced slicing or filtering, but for this problem, standard list slicing should suffice. \n\n    We can also consider using the `functools` module for memoization or caching, but this is not necessary for this problem. \n\n    We can"}
