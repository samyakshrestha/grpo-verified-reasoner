Non-CoT: model completes the function body directly.\n","   - CoT: model is instructed to emit reasoning followed by a `<SOLUTION>` block.\n","\n","2. **Batch Generation**\n","   - All HumanEval tasks are generated using **vLLM batch inference** for speed and determinism.\n","   - Stop tokens are applied to prevent over-generation.\n","\n","3. **Output Sanitization**\n","   A custom `cleaner` function enforces:\n","   - Strict `<SOLUTION>` extraction (CoT only)\n","   - Markdown fence removal (```python … ```)\n","   - Redundant `def` removal\n","   - Docstring stripping\n","   - Robust indentation normalization compatible with the HumanEval harness\n","\n","4. **Execution-Based Scoring**\n","   - Each completion is executed against the official HumanEval tests.\n","   - Results are aggregated into a single results table.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Metrics\n","\n","- **pass@1**: fraction of problems solved correctly on the first attempt\n","- Results are reported per model and per generation mode (CoT / non-CoT)\n","\n","Duplicate rows from batched generation are explicitly deduplicated before scoring.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Output Artifacts\n","\n","- `*_non_cot.jsonl` — raw non-CoT completions\n","- `*_cot.jsonl` — raw CoT completions\n","- `df_results` — consolidated evaluation table with pass@1 scores\n","\n","These artifacts form the **final empirical evidence** for assessing GRPO effectiveness.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Result Summary\n","\n","- Generation stability issues (empty outputs, truncation) were resolved by:\n","  - Removing aggressive repetition penalties\n","  - Correcting stop-token logic\n","  - Fixing markdown and tag-handling bugs in the cleaner\n","- Final runs achieved **near-complete coverage** (≤1 empty completion out of 164)\n","- GRPO shows measurable gains over Base and SFT under controlled conditions"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"qMEo3HOH-slR"},"source":["# Step 1: Mounting Google Drive and Importing Libraries\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":17216,"status":"ok","timestamp":1767410604652,"user":{"displayName":"Samyak Shrestha","userId":"13083503381857072620"},"user_tz":360},"id":"yrrwKNmg-lNR","outputId":"5be0afaa-7f0f-48c8-d56e-03741efc62b0"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/grpo-verified-reasoner\n","data\t\t\t      LICENSE\t outputs    unsloth_compiled_cache\n","grpo_trainer_lora_model       models\t README.md  _unsloth_sentencepiece_temp\n","huggingface_tokenizers_cache  notebooks  src\t    wandb\n"]}],"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount(\"/content/drive\")\n","%cd /content/drive/MyDrive/grpo-verified-reasoner\n","!ls"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"0q0FVqc67uRU"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Install UV (Faster pip)\n","!pip install --upgrade -qqq uv"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"ZKwjGl3V7zI1"},"outputs":[],"source":["import os\n","import subprocess"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"imojZdcn7ztn"},"outputs":[],"source":["os.environ[\"PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF\"] = \"expandable_segments:False\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"5Y5vd4i8712_"},"outputs":[],"source":["# os.environ[\"UNSLOTH_VLLM_STANDBY\"] = \"1\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"vAQLD8-a9blY"},"outputs":[],"source":["if \"COLAB_\" not in \"\".join(os.environ.keys()):\n","    !pip install -q unsloth vllm human-eval tqdm\n","else:\n","    # Version matching for Colab GPUs\n","    try:\n","        import numpy, PIL\n","        get_numpy = f\"numpy=={numpy.__version__}\"\n","        get_pil   = f\"pillow=={PIL.__version__}\"\n","    except Exception:\n","        get_numpy, get_pil = \"numpy\", \"pillow\"\n","\n","    try:\n","        is_t4 = \"Tesla T4\" in str(subprocess.check_output([\"nvidia-smi\"]))\n","    except Exception:\n","        is_t4 = False\n","\n","    # A100/H100: vllm 0.10.2, T4: vllm 0.9.2 + pinned triton\n","    get_vllm, get_triton = (\"vllm==0.9.2\", \"triton==3.2.0\") if is_t4 else (\"vllm==0.10.2\", \"triton\")\n","\n","    !uv pip install -qqq --upgrade \\\n","        unsloth {get_vllm} {get_numpy} {get_pil} torchvision bitsandbytes xformers tqdm human-eval\n","    !uv pip install -qqq {get_triton}"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":36096,"status":"ok","timestamp":1767410730264,"user":{"displayName":"Samyak Shrestha","userId":"13083503381857072620"},"user_tz":360},"id":"f4hqdCI59tMU","outputId":"8a10c49b-8987-471e-bed0-a1927251ee3c"},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["/tmp/ipython-input-1905740597.py:12: UserWarning: WARNING: Unsloth should be imported before [transformers] to ensure all optimizations are applied.
